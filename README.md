# metapost-examples

Some example documents and drawings, showing off what you can do with Metapost and `luamplib`.

## PWW-2 

This an attempt to re-draw some of the drawings from Roger Nelsen's "Proofs
without words II".  The intent is to provide a tutorial to drawing with plain
Metapost, as well as to show what can be done with `mplib` and `lualatex`.  The
source of the PDF file is a single tex file with each drawing as a separate
`mplib` environment.  There are some external Metapost files.  You will also
need the `metapost-colorbrewer` package installed, and the TeX Gyre Pagella and
TeX Gyre Pagella Math fonts installed and available to `fontspec`.

The document is strictly for educational and tutorial purposes only.  All the
original book and therefore all the pictures are copyrighted by the
Mathematical Association of America. My Metapost source files are covered by
